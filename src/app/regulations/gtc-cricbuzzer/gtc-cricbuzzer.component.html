        12.3. Where any term of the offer or promotion is breached or there is any
        evidence of a series of bets placed by a customer or group of customers,
        which due to a deposit bonus, enhanced payments, free bets, risk free bets
        or any other promotional offer results in guaranteed customer profits
        irrespective of the outcome, whether individually or as part of a group,

      </p>
      <p>
        12.7. You acknowledge and understand that separate terms and conditions
        exist with respect to promotions, bonuses and special offers, and are in
        addition to these terms and conditions. These terms and conditions are set
        forth in the respective content page on this website (<a href="https://{{domain}}">www.{{domain}}</a>),
        or have been made available to you personally, as the case may be. In the
        event of a conflict between the provisions of such promotions, bonuses and

        before you can bet with any free/bonus funds we credit to your account.
      </p>
      <p>
        12.9 You accept that certain promotions may be subject to withdrawal
        restrictions and/or requirements which need to be met before funds

        12.10 Winnings from wagers placed using a free bet are calculated as the
        'total returns less the amount staked (including the amount of the free

      <p>
        12.12. You must use all bonuses and/ or bonus programs within 48 hours
        from receiving the bonus on your Member Account. When a bonus and/ or

        <a href="https://{{domain}}">{{domain}}</a> reserves the right to cancel any such bonus and/ or bonus
        program and may deduct the bonus or bonus-like reward or free spin
        immediately after the lapse of the 48 hours period.
      </p>
      <p>
        12.13. When incentives (including but not limited to free bets or free
        spins) are being offered in exchange for customer views, opinions,

        of the survey/promotion.
      </p>
      <p>
        12.14. Promotions may be published in several languages for informational
        purposes and ease of access by players. The English version is the only
        legal basis of the relationship between you and us and in the case of any

        winnings should there be any investigation resulting from suspicion of
        criminal activities or any manipulation that may have affected the result.
        If an irregularity is in either betting patterns or event outcome is
        confirmed by the governing authority, third party or <a href="https://{{domain}}">{{domain}}</a>,
        <a href="https://{{domain}}">{{domain}}</a> retains the right to void and/or refund any staked amount
        placed on the event at our discretion. In the case that any bets have
        already been resulted, <a href="https://{{domain}}">{{domain}}</a> retains the right to resettle the
        event outcome and confiscate any winnings associated.
      </p>
      <p>
        13.3. Should <a href="https://{{domain}}">{{domain}}</a> become aware that you have placed a number of
        bets from different accounts you have irregularly opened, all bets will be
        voidable at the unfettered discretion of <a href="https://{{domain}}">{{domain}}</a>. <a href="https://{{domain}}">{{domain}}</a>
        retains the right to take further action as it deems necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        13.4. If bets which exceed the stated maximum bet amounts, are erroneously
        accepted by <a href="https://{{domain}}">{{domain}}</a>, the excess amount will be disregarded and the
        bet amount placed will be revised accordingly and the difference shall be
        refunded/credited to your account.
      </p>
      <p>
        13.5. Live video streaming, statistics, live scores, live betting or

      <p>
        13.6. If a match does not start on the scheduled starting date or starts
        but is later postponed and/or abandoned and is not completed (resumed) by
        the end of the next calendar date, all bets will be void except for any
        bets determined to be unconditional under the rules of the relevant
        market, in which case, the bet may stand.
      </p>
      <p>
        13.7. <a href="https://{{domain}}">{{domain}}</a> reserves the right to adopt special rules, applicable
        for particular matches or events that may be contradictory to the
        Sportsbook Rules. Such special rules may be published in conjunction with
        published odds for particular regions, customers, matches and/or events.
      </p>
      <p>
        13.8. Should there be a break in communication after you place your bet
        and/or you receive no visual confirmation that a bet has been successfully
        placed, but the bet is correctly received on our servers, the bet shall be
        deemed as valid and accepted. You will be informed whether you have won or
        lost once communication is re-established and result determined. If the
        bet is not received correctly on our servers due to a communication error,
        it shall not be regarded as valid and accepted; and the failed bet shall
        be returned to your account balance.
      </p>
      <p>
        13.9. If you are unsatisfied with any matter relating to a bet with
        <a href="https://{{domain}}">{{domain}}</a>, please notify <a href="https://{{domain}}">{{domain}}</a> within 7 days in writing after

        in our system, you agree that the results in our system's transaction logs
        verified by an officer of <a href="https://{{domain}}">{{domain}}</a> shall be final, conclusive and
        binding.
      </p>

        possible exposure by the details provided on the online betting

        for a match, the prevailing source for statistics are the ones listed
        under our General Sports Betting Rules page.
      </p>
      <p>
        13.14. The maximum stake is dependent on the amount <a href="https://{{domain}}">{{domain}}</a> accepts
        at the time of your bet. If a bet amount is higher than the automatic
        acceptance level set out on the betslip offered on the Website (which is
        subject to change without prior notice), such a bet will be manually
        reviewed and approved or declined and we reserve the right to decline any
        bet or part thereof that is subject to such manual verification. Any bet
        that has not been manually approved before the game has started is voided
        in full. You have the right to void any bet that is subject to manual
        approval until such bet has been accepted by <a href="https://{{domain}}">{{domain}}</a>.
      </p>

          changes or a market suspends then the Cash Out request may not be
          successful.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the Cash Out request is successful, this will be displayed and the
          bet will be settled immediately. The actual final result of the original
          bet will have no impact on the Cash Out amount.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Cash Out amount offered at any time is the total amount that will be

        22.1. <a href="https://{{domain}}">{{domain}}</a> operates under a Cura&ccedil;ao Gaming licence issued
        by the Government of the Netherlands Antilles. Our online products are all
        supplied by companies with approved e-Gaming Cura&ccedil;ao licensing and
        status. All products operated by <a href="https://{{domain}}">{{domain}}</a> go through a vigorous
        testing process before launch, including internal testing and External
        Compliance Testing (ECT) by our own teams. Conducted ECT covers elements
        including but not limited to functionality, display, transaction, rules
        and mathematics ensuring product compliance to regulatory requirements.
        Additional internal compliance is also conducted to ensure other
        functionality around integration testing and user acceptance testing,
        further guaranteeing integrated games perform up to the expected user
        experience standard. Our games all offer unpredictable game play and
        possibilities of large wins and losses, but the average long term return
        of a game can be calculated using the Theoretical Return to Player (RTP)
        value using either a theoretical or simulated approach adjusted according
        to the game type. The Theoretical RTP value is as suggested - a
        theoretical calculation disclosing expected wage percentage player return
        after a certain amount of plays. Visit the information section of the game
        to find more information about RTP of specific games.
