                    <p class="paraghraph">Exchange Blackjack brings together the world's most famous casino game and
                        Betfair's unique back and lay system.
                        Four automated players battle against the dealer, to see who can get closest to 21. Instead of
                        you deciding to hit or stand in the game, each player automatically plays a perfect game using
                        Betfair Games 'Perfect Strategy'. There are up to seven rounds of betting in each game, allowing
                        you to back or lay each player as the game unfolds. In addition there are four 'exotic' bets,
                        including 'dealer wins or ties all' and '1 or more has 5 cards'.

                    </p>

                    <h6 class="main">What are decimal odds?</h6>

                    <p class="paraghraph">
                        Decimal odds express your total return for the stake you place. Therefore even money is
                        expressed as
                        2.0 - you get back your initial stake plus the same again as winnings - twice your initial
                        stake. To
                        see other odds use the odds converter.

                        all of the hands have been resolved (i.e. it is unknown whether they will win, lose or tie). For
                        example, if prior to the Dealer taking a third card, 3 players have busted and 1 player has a
                        Blackjack and the Dealer cannot possibly get a 5 card Charlie because they have 15 or 16, then
                        the
                        dealer cannot possibly win, the player will be settled as a winner and the game finishes without

                        Betfair's unique back and lay system.</p>

                    <p class="paraghraph">Four automated players battle against the dealer, to see who can get closest
                        to 21. Instead of you deciding to hit or stand in the game, each player automatically plays a
                        perfect game using Betfair Games 'Perfect Strategy'. There are up to seven rounds of betting in
                        each game, allowing you to back or lay each player as the game unfolds. In addition there are
                        four 'exotic' bets, including 'dealer wins or ties all' and '1 or more has 5 cards'.

                    <h6 class="main">What are decimal odds?</h6>

                    <p class="paraghraph">
                        Decimal odds express your total return for the stake you place. Therefore even money is
                        expressed as 2.0 - you get back your initial stake plus the same again as winnings - twice your
                        initial stake. To see other odds use the odds converter.

                        example, if prior to the Dealer taking a third card, 3 players have busted and 1 player has a
                        Blackjack and the Dealer cannot possibly get a 5 card Charlie because they have 15 or 16, then
                        the

                    <h6 class="main">What are decimal odds?</h6>

                    <p class="paraghraph">
                        Decimal odds express your total return for the stake you place. Therefore even money is
                        expressed as 2.0 - you get back your initial stake plus the same again as winnings - twice your
                        initial stake. To see other odds use the odds converter.

                    <p class="paraghraph">
                        Decimal odds express your total return for the stake you place. Therefore even money is
                        expressed as 2.0 - you get back your initial stake plus the same again as winnings - twice your
                        initial stake. To see other odds use the odds converter.

                        Hi game. The two markets each hold different types of betting selections. The first market is
                        known as the main market and contains the betting selections for the Game Outcome, i.e. Hand 1,
                        Hand 2, Hand 3 and Hand 4. This market is known as a ‘Win Only Market’ and generally only a
                        single selection will win (however it is possible for a dead heat to occur when the winning
                        selections will be settled according to the dead heat rules). The Side bets market is also a
                        ‘Win Only Market’, however for this market each of the selections are mutually exclusive and
                        therefore one of the selections will win, and the other selections will be settled as losers.
                        It’s also important to note that the main and side bets markets are two separate markets with
                        commission on each charged at according to the standard Betfair commission charging model.
                        The side bets selections are as follows:
